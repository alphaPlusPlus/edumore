## Project structure

Folder | Description
------ | -----------
`dist/` | Production ready code
`src/` | Development sources
`src/css/` | Autogenerated CSS files (this folder is needed only for Browsersync)


## Development

### To install dev dependencies, run:

`yarn` or `npm install`


### To start watch mode (Browsersync will serve files from the `src` folder), run:

`gulp watch`

Now you can edit files in the `src` folder, and watch the result in your browser.
P.S. If your browser doesn't automatically open a new tab, type in `localhost:3000` in your browser's url field.


### To build the sources (Gulp will generate production ready code into the `dist` folder), run:

`gulp dist`
